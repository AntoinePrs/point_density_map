# Point density map

This script was created to make a very minimalist map of the Brasilian population using dot density. 
For every 1000 inhabitants, a dot with random coordinated is generated within the boundaries of the
municipality. 

## Data
The data used for the example comes from the *Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística*

For the population:
